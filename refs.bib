Cryptocurrency may be the currency of the future, but it is also the heaven for con artists to scam investors from their money. Crypto transactions are irreversible. If the underlying blockchain technology has privacy or mixer capabilities it can be virtually untraceable, which creates a new avenue for criminals to scam victims with ease. Social media impersonation is one of the top scams currently performed by criminals. This study presents an example of a social media impersonation scam and the characteristics of the scam. The qualitative data is gathered from communication between the scammer and the potential victim. This study also indicates that cryptocurrency awareness should be included in cyber security training curriculums.},

Exploiting two natural experiments in which exchanges altered their P\&D policies, we show that P\&Ds are detrimental to cryptocurrency liquidity and prices. Interestingly, gambling and overconfident investors often participate in P\&Ds and some investors exhibit naïve reinforcement learning.

	abstract = {The cryptocurrency market has gained significant traction in the last decade, becoming an alternative finance platform to traditional stock market trading. Despite its rapid evolution, legal regulations have not yet caught up to the cryptocurrency market’s progress, attracting the attention of scammers looking to exploit legal loopholes for profits. Pump-and-dump schemes, a well-worn fraud device, has regained relevance in this new territory. In a typical pump-and-dump scheme, scammers organize and leverage media channels to artificially inflate the price of an alternative cryptocurrency, only to quickly sell them to profit off unsuspecting buyers. The disruptive nature of pump-and-dump schemes necessitates a system to reliably forecast pump targets and the magnitude of its success. In this paper, we propose an approach to predict the target cryptocurrency for each pump before its announcement using market and social media signals using Neural Network-based architectures while offering interpretable insights into their black-box nature. Additionally, we construct models that are capable of forecasting the highest price induced by the pump after the cryptocurrency’s identity is revealed within 6.1\% error margin. We examine the optimal temporal windows and describe the limitations of social data to predict the manipulations in cryptocurrency trade. Our experimental results serve as proof of a feasible forecasting expert system for identifying cryptocurrency pump-and-dump frauds using publicly available data.},

To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy for practical use. More importantly, the approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes even at the moment of its creation. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 400 Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.},

	abstract = {Uniswap, like other {DEXs}, has gained much attention this year because it is a non-custodial and publicly veriﬁable exchange that allows users to trade digital assets without trusted third parties. However, its simplicity and lack of regulation also makes it easy to execute initial coin offering scams by listing non-valuable tokens. This method of performing scams is known as rug pull, a phenomenon that already existed in traditional ﬁnance but has become more relevant in {DeFi}. Various projects such as [34, 37] have contributed to detecting rug pulls in {EVM} compatible chains. However, the ﬁrst longitudinal and academic step to detecting and characterizing scam tokens on Uniswap was made in [44]. The authors collected all the transactions related to the Uniswap V2 exchange and proposed a machine learning algorithm to label tokens as scams. However, the algorithm is only valuable for detecting scams accurately after they have been executed. This paper increases their data set by 20K tokens and proposes a new methodology to label tokens as scams. After manually analyzing the data, we devised a theoretical classiﬁcation of different malicious maneuvers in Uniswap protocol. We propose various machine-learning-based algorithms with new relevant features related to the token propagation and smart contract heuristics to detect potential rug pulls before they occur. In general, the models proposed achieved similar results. The best model obtained an accuracy of 0.9936, recall of 0.9540, and precision of 0.9838 in distinguishing non-malicious tokens from scams prior to the malicious maneuver.},

In this paper, we propose a system to detect the blacklisted addresses in the Ethereum blockchain. First, we collected Ethereum blockchain transaction data and blacklisted addresses. Then, we constructed the transaction graph of Ethereum and extracted features of addresses, including some global features like pagerank. Finally, we trained the models of standard machine learning algorithms and predicted the class of the addresses. Our results show that with more than 97\% accuracy we can predict blacklisted addresses.},

However, because of its unique anonymity, digital currency has become a haven for all kinds of cyber crimes. It has been reported that Ethereum frauds provide huge profits, and pose a serious threat to the financial security of the Ethereum network. To create a desired financial environment, an effective method is urgently needed to automatically detect and identify Ethereum frauds in the governance of the Ethereum system. In view of this, this paper proposes a method for detecting Ethereum frauds by mining Ethereum-based transaction records. Specifically, web crawlers are used to capture labeled fraudulent addresses, and then a transaction network is reconstructed based on the public transaction book. Then, an amount-based network embedding algorithm is proposed to extract node features for identifying fraudulent transactions. At last, the graph convolutional network model is used to classify addresses into legal addresses and fraudulent addresses. The experimental results show that the system for detecting fraudulent transactions can achieve the accuracy of 95\%, which reflects the excellent performance of the system for detecting Ethereum fraudulent transactions.},

As such in this paper, a neural-network based approach has been presented for Ethereum fraud detection and to validate the effects of the performance this proposed model has been compared with its peers. In contrast to the various models such as Logistic Regression, {SVM}, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbour, the neural network perform the best providing an accuracy of about 97.09\% which is higher than the rest. It is then seen that neural networks are relatively effective in learning complex patterns of the dataset and thus classifying the resultant transaction as genuine or fraudulent.

However, this adoption has been accompanied by a surge in cryptocurrency fraud, causing significant losses to financial organizations and individuals. One way to mitigate these losses is to use Federated Learning ({FL}) techniques to detect fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions. This paper provides an overview of secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable Blockchain-based Federated Learning ({BCFL}) as a promising solution for slowing the exponential growth of cryptocurrency fraud. {BCFL} enables multiple entities to collaboratively train machine learning models for detecting fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions without sharing their private data, thus preserving privacy. However, Integrating differential privacy and Secure Multi-party computation ({SMPC}) models in {BCFL} presents an additional scalability challenge. This study provides an overview of {BCFL}, evaluating existing research on its security, privacy, and scalability challenges in detecting cryptocurrency fraud. The review explores existing research and various methodologies, highlighting advancements and challenges in creating effective, privacy-conscious fraud detection solutions for cryptocurrency transactions. We first discuss the current state of {BCFL} in fraud detection, along with its potential advantages and limitations, and then discuss the existing research gaps. In particular, this paper examines various {BCFL} frameworks, consensus algorithms, and block architectures, emphasizing their strengths and limitations in the context of cryptocurrency fraud detection to develop scalable and privacy-preserving solutions. We compare various solutions that address scalability and privacy challenges in {BCFL}, including adopting a geographically distributed cloud computing model that utilizes {SMPC} and lightweight consensus algorithms and protocols to manage computational overheads.},

	abstract = {The prosperity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem drives the need for digital asset trading platforms. Beyond centralized exchanges ({CEXs}), decentralized exchanges ({DEXs}) are introduced to allow users to trade cryptocurrency without transferring the custody of their digital assets to the middlemen, thus eliminating the security and privacy issues of traditional {CEX}. Uniswap, as the most prominent cryptocurrency {DEX}, is continuing to attract scammers, with fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take the first step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first collect all the transactions related to Uniswap V2 exchange and investigate the landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives. Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap based on a guilt-by-association heuristic and a machine-learning powered technique. We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on Uniswap, which suggests that roughly 50\% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam tokens and liquidity pools are created specialized for the "rug pull" scams, and some scam tokens have embedded tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts. We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help carry out the scams in league with the scam token/pool creators. The scammers have gained a profit of at least {\textbackslash}\$16 million from 39,762 potential victims. Our observations in this paper suggest the urgency to identify and stop scams in the decentralized finance ecosystem, and our approach can act as a whistleblower that identifies scam tokens at their early stages.},
